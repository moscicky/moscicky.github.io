In January, I had a pleasure to present a talk titled "Building a Vector Search Engine" at the MLops meetup (MOPS) in Warsaw.

During the talk I covered the topics of:
- approximate nearest neighbors search algorithms for faster search
- vector compression techniques 
- indices evaluation

The presentation was not as fluent as I would like it to be and there were some 
mistakes here and there but practice makes perfect:)
